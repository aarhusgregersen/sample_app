# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application

This is the sample application for the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial:
Learn Web Development with Rails*](http://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).

This is actually my first try at doing something as simple as editing the readme on github. Simple, but small victory and I'll take what I can get! WOOOHOOO!
